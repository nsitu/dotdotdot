# Basis Transcoder WASM 

The transcoder (`basis_transcoder.wasm`) is used by Three.js to decode/transcode existing Basis Universal textures to a supported GPU format. It has been sourced from [https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/examples/jsm/libs/basis](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/examples/jsm/libs/basis).
